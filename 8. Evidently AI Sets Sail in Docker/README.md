# 🚢 Evidently AI Sets Sail in Docker: A Voyage into Data Monitoring 🐳📊

## 📌 Introduction

This guide walks through setting up an Evidently AI-based Streamlit application running inside a Docker container. The application:

-   Uses `Evidently AI` for monitoring machine learning models.
-   Provides an interactive dashboard in `Streamlit`.
-   Organizes reports and projects efficiently.
-   Uses `Docker` for easy deployment and management.

## 📂 Project Structure

Ensure your working directory contains the following files and folders:

```
📁 evidently-ai-streamlit
 ├── 📂 projects                # Contains different ML monitoring projects
 │    ├── 📂 project_1
 │    │    ├── 📂 reports       # Stores monitoring reports
 │    │    ├── ...
 │    ├── 📂 project_2

## 📝 Main Application (app.py - Overview)

The `app.py` script:

-   Loads available projects and reports dynamically.
-   Allows users to select a project, period, and report.
-   Renders `Evidently AI` reports inside `Streamlit`.
-   Handles errors gracefully if a project or report is missing.
-   Uses `src/ui.py` for UI elements and `src/utils.py` for helper functions.

Key functions:

-   `display_sidebar_header()`: Renders the sidebar with branding and navigation.
-   `select_project()`: Lets users pick a project.
-   `select_period()`: Allows selection of a reporting period.
-   `select_report()`: Fetches available reports.
-   `display_report()`: Loads and displays the selected report.

## 🐳 Dockerfile (Containerizing Streamlit App)

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python base image
FROM python:3.10

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire project into the container
COPY . /app/

# Expose the port Streamlit runs on
EXPOSE 8501

# Run the Streamlit app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```
